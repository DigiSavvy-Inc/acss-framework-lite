# ACSS Framework Lite

A lightweight, variable-driven CSS framework inspired by [Automatic.css](https://automaticcss.com) philosophy, focusing on consistency, mathematical precision, and contextual design patterns.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains the Custom ACSS Framework Lite - a standalone CSS framework that implements the core principles of Automatic.css without requiring WordPress.

### What's Included

- **custom-css-framework/** - The complete CSS framework source and build files
- **automatic-css-llm.txt** - Comprehensive guide for AI/LLM usage with ACSS principles

### What's NOT Included

The WordPress plugin (`automaticcss-plugin/`) is maintained in a separate repository for cleaner separation of concerns.

cd custom-css-framework/

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the framework
npm run build

# Watch for changes during development
